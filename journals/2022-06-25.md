	- Being Boring – [[iA writer]]
		- https://ia.net/topics/being-boring
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- It’s not [[PowerPoint]]’s fault that we spend half our lives pretending to speak and pretending to listen. At the same time, PowerPoint is not entirely innocent:
				- > “…responsibility for poor presentations rests with the presenter. But it is more complicated than that. PP has a distinctive, definite, well-enforced, and widely-practiced cognitive style that is contrary to serious thinking. PP actively facilitates the making of lightweight presentations.”
			- PowerPoint is not designed to make and hold captivating presentations.
				- It’s designed to make us design slides, pretend that we know what we are talking about, and make others accept boring, empty speeches as normal.
			- Why does no one stand up and stop these boring bullet-point bonanzas? Why are we still using it ourselves?

			- tl;dr As a hackathon project at our recent team offsite, Mati and I hacked together a quick experiment to test whether Bionic Reading actually works.

	- [[Sex]] Is Going Out Of Fashion
		- Author: [[Loudt Darrow]]

		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Sex is going out of fashion.
			- Pushed away by virtual imitations and decaff substitutes that, though nowhere near as gratifying as taking a real trip to pound town, are enough to pacify our sex drive in the convenience of a few left-handed clicks.
			- Turns out that the human libido is much more delicate than we thought, so if you find yourself so overstimulated nothing turns you on anymore, the solution might be to turn everything off for a little while.
