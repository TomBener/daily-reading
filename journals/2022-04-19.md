- 少数价值
	- https://blog.joway.io/posts/minority-values/
	- ✏️ Highlights
		- 我 [[1995]] 年出生，所经历的教育完全是经过中国人民共和国 [[教育部]] 批准，合法合规，符合社会主义价值观的中国式教育，在我整段学生生涯中，我一直认为我的价值观是这个社会里的主流价值观，也是这个教育系统希望我拥有的价值观。
			- 在我受教育的年代，
				- 我们曾经和国家共同相信 [[民主]] 是未来的发展方向，
				- 共同相信侵略是反人类行为，
				- 共同相信 [[全球化]] 是历史的潮流，
				- 共同相信 [[恐怖主义]] 是要被谴责的行为，
				- 共同相信 [[市场经济]] 带给了中国空前的繁荣。
			- 当时的我们虽不认为我们国家已经实现了这些价值，但是绝大部分人包括 [[国家机器]] 都认同我们确实享有这样的价值观，而争歧无非是如何实现这些价值观，何时应当去按这些价值观践行。
		- 我不再愿意和任何人辩论，甚至不再愿意接受不同的观点。
			- 如果 [[苏格拉底]] 是错的，如果 [[鲁迅]] 是错的，如果 [[启蒙运动]] 是错的，如果 [[独立宣言]] 是错的，那我愿意带着这些古老的错误直到死去，也不愿意再去用新的理论，新的叙事，重新学习新时代的多数价值。
			- 如果他们是对的，如果他们会笼罩我一生，我也认了，我宁愿一生成为一个碌碌无为的错误，也不愿再推翻我过去的信仰成为一个前途光明的正确。
		- 我失去了语言，也失去了使用语言的勇气，
			- 只能在评论区给我的同类点赞，在黑色幽默里寻找光明的踪迹，在一篇篇即将被删除的文章里获取慰藉。
			- [[赛博空间]] 里充斥着正确，让错误无处可逃，只有远处时不时传来的一声声尖叫。
- Comfort in solitude – A Learning a Day

	- ✏️ Highlights
		- > “I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.”
			- [[Blaise Pascal]]
		- There is no amount of love or money that can help us if we’re unable to enjoy the time we spend with ourselves.
		- Our ability to make peace with ourselves, to find comfort in solitude helps us act from wholeness instead of our wounds.
- Big Media, Big Conflicts of Interest, Part 1: The Consolidation Craze & Illusion of Choice
	- Author: [[Rebecca Strong]]

	- ✏️ Highlights
		- As regulations around ownership have continued to loosen over the last 40 years,
			- the power over the media has become increasingly concentrated.
			- A major culprit is the Telecommunications Act signed by then-President [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1996]], which 72% of the public didn’t even know about and no one voted on.
		- Today, Comcast, Disney, AT&T, Sony, Fox, and Paramount Global control 90% of what you watch, read, or listen to.
			- These companies spend millions on lobbying each year to sway legislation in their favor.
		- Local news is dying out,
			- with more than 2,000 U.S. counties (63.6%) now lacking a daily newspaper.
		- Interlocking directorates — which describe situations in which a board member at a media company also sits on the board at other companies, also create conflicts of interest.
			- Publicly traded American newspapers are interlocked by 1,276 connections to 530 organizations,
				- including advertisers, financial institutions, tech ﬁrms, and government/political entities.
			- These interlocks are only disclosed to readers about half the time.
		- More than 30% of editors report experiencing some form of pressure on the newsroom from their parent company or its board of directors.
			- Pressured editors admit to taking a more relaxed approach in reporting practices when covering interlocked individuals or organizations in the news.
		- Half of [[investigative journalist]]s say newsworthy stories often or sometimes go unreported
			- because they could hurt the financial interests of their organization,
			- and 61% believe corporate owners exert at least a fair amount of influence on decisions about which stories to cover.
- [[Immigration]] by Country, as a Percentage of the Population
	- Author: [[Raul Amoros]]
	- https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/mapped-immigration-by-country-as-a-percentage-of-the-population
	- ✏️ Highlights
		- There were 272 million immigrants in 2020, amounting to 3.5% of the [[global population]].
		- The [UN]([[United Nations]]) defines an immigrant as someone who has been living in a country other than their country of birth for one year or longer.
			- In addition to new citizens or residents, a variety of people fit under this definition:
				- [[Foreign worker]]s
				- [[International student]]s
				- [[Refugee]]s
		- The UN also includes estimates of unauthorized immigrants living in various countries.
		- On the flip side, tourists, temporary workers, and overseas military personnel are typically not included.

		- In the hermit kingdom that is [[North Korea]], a flurry of obvious signs attest of the servitude of the individual to an [[ideology]]:
			- whilst flags and slogans praise the party, monuments, statues and portraits bear the image of their leaders.
		- As what is hidden is out of reach, it is only by showing [[everyday life]] in its gritty reality that is possible to make the levers of power visible and tangible.
			- Such neutrality can be extremely powerful:
				- revealing to what extent this [regime]([[authoritarian regime]]) operates like an hallucinatory machine hypnotizing an entire people, turning reality into a show.

		- A concept worth understanding:
			- The Earth does not belong to us;
			- we belong to the Earth.
			- One of the best ways to start acting with [[gratitude]] and respect for that which sustains all life is to read Robin Wall Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass.
		- A book worth reading:
			- [Sleep]([[ 💤 sleep]]) is one of the least understood, yet most important and most neglected aspects of our life.
			- In _Why We Sleep_, [[Matthew Walker]] shows how such a basic activity can have such profound effects on almost everything.
		- An activity worth doing:
			- Make things by hand.
				- It is deeply satisfying to turn raw materials into tangible objects that serve a purpose.
				- Learning how to make tangible things also means learning how to fix things.
				- It helps reduce disposable consumption and makes us more conscious of the material footprint of all the things in our life.
		- A [saying](((625e6a66-83f4-4fd7-a0c1-8bd8ed55980a))) worth repeating:
			- ‘==Be curious, not judgemental.==’
			- We are wired to try to explain the world around us.
			- When lacking obvious explanations, most of us quickly jump to conclusions before getting the complete picture. It is always better to ask than to assume.
