	- ✏️ Highlights
		- As regulations around ownership have continued to loosen over the last 40 years,
			- the power over the media has become increasingly concentrated.
			- A major culprit is the Telecommunications Act signed by then-President [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1996]], which 72% of the public didn’t even know about and no one voted on.
		- Today, Comcast, Disney, AT&T, Sony, Fox, and Paramount Global control 90% of what you watch, read, or listen to.
			- These companies spend millions on lobbying each year to sway legislation in their favor.
		- Local news is dying out,
			- with more than 2,000 U.S. counties (63.6%) now lacking a daily newspaper.
		- Interlocking directorates — which describe situations in which a board member at a media company also sits on the board at other companies, also create conflicts of interest.
			- Publicly traded American newspapers are interlocked by 1,276 connections to 530 organizations,
				- including advertisers, financial institutions, tech ﬁrms, and government/political entities.
			- These interlocks are only disclosed to readers about half the time.
		- More than 30% of editors report experiencing some form of pressure on the newsroom from their parent company or its board of directors.
			- Pressured editors admit to taking a more relaxed approach in reporting practices when covering interlocked individuals or organizations in the news.
		- Half of [[investigative journalist]]s say newsworthy stories often or sometimes go unreported
			- because they could hurt the financial interests of their organization,
			- and 61% believe corporate owners exert at least a fair amount of influence on decisions about which stories to cover.
- [[Immigration]] by Country, as a Percentage of the Population

	- ✏️ Highlights
		- There were 272 million immigrants in 2020, amounting to 3.5% of the [[global population]].
		- The [UN]([[United Nations]]) defines an immigrant as someone who has been living in a country other than their country of birth for one year or longer.
			- In addition to new citizens or residents, a variety of people fit under this definition:
				- [[Foreign worker]]s
				- [[International student]]s
				- [[Refugee]]s
		- The UN also includes estimates of unauthorized immigrants living in various countries.
		- On the flip side, tourists, temporary workers, and overseas military personnel are typically not included.

		- In the hermit kingdom that is [[North Korea]], a flurry of obvious signs attest of the servitude of the individual to an [[ideology]]:
			- whilst flags and slogans praise the party, monuments, statues and portraits bear the image of their leaders.
		- As what is hidden is out of reach, it is only by showing [[everyday life]] in its gritty reality that is possible to make the levers of power visible and tangible.
			- Such neutrality can be extremely powerful:
				- revealing to what extent this [regime]([[authoritarian regime]]) operates like an hallucinatory machine hypnotizing an entire people, turning reality into a show.

		- A concept worth understanding:
			- The Earth does not belong to us;
			- we belong to the Earth.
			- One of the best ways to start acting with [[gratitude]] and respect for that which sustains all life is to read Robin Wall Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass.
		- A book worth reading:
			- [Sleep]([[ 💤 sleep]]) is one of the least understood, yet most important and most neglected aspects of our life.
			- In _Why We Sleep_, [[Matthew Walker]] shows how such a basic activity can have such profound effects on almost everything.
		- An activity worth doing:
			- Make things by hand.
				- It is deeply satisfying to turn raw materials into tangible objects that serve a purpose.
				- Learning how to make tangible things also means learning how to fix things.
				- It helps reduce disposable consumption and makes us more conscious of the material footprint of all the things in our life.
		- A [saying](((625e6a66-83f4-4fd7-a0c1-8bd8ed55980a))) worth repeating:
			- ==‘Be curious, not judgemental.’==
			- We are wired to try to explain the world around us.
			- When lacking obvious explanations, most of us quickly jump to conclusions before getting the complete picture. It is always better to ask than to assume.
