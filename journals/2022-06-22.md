			- （一）
				- 出了 [[嘉峪关]]，两眼泪不干。
				- 前看戈壁滩，后看鬼门关。
			- （二）
				- 别了父母别家乡，别了贤妻和儿郎。
				- 今日要到口外去，不知何时能回还。
			- （三）
				- 走出关外看风向，寒风刺骨透心凉。
				- 每月狂风廿九天，还有一日是阴天。
			- （四）
				- 穷八站来富八站，不穷不富又八站。
				- 如果中途不遇伴，沙漠滩上丧黄泉!

		- Here are the investigation’s major revelations:

			- Chinese police analyze human behaviors to ensure [[facial recognition]] cameras capture as much activity as possible.
			- Authorities are using phone trackers to link people’s digital lives to their physical movements.
			- [[DNA]], [[iris scan]] samples and voice prints are being collected indiscriminately from people with no connection to crime.
			- The [[Chinese government]] wants to connect all of these data points to build comprehensive profiles for citizens — which are accessible throughout the government.
	- [[网络暴力]] 与情绪的社会维度
		- Author: [[三联生活周刊]]
		- http://www.lifeweek.com.cn/article/160828
		- https://archive.ph/KPXrd
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- 早年 [[BBS]] 时代，人们还以长文章为单位，通过写文章的方式在论坛上吵架，有理有据，相互辩论，谁骂人谁就输了。
				- 当人们进入 [[社交媒体时代]] 之后，一条 [[微博]] 只能最多 140 个字，甚至变成一段 15 秒的 [[短视频]] 之后，表达方式发生彻底变化。
			- [[中国政法大学]] 社会学院副教授 [[孟庆延]] 表示自己的方向并非做社会心理学研究，也并非专门研究网络暴力。
				- 在研究中他发现，不同的社会历史大变革时期，都会出现人群的极化现象， #政治极化
					- 各种观念的斗争，以及各种情绪上的对立和立场的分裂，暴力自人类进入现代社会以来就未曾变化，只是形态变了，延伸到现在就是所谓的网络暴力——网络只是介质，暴力才是本质。
			- 「共情能力」不是指一味认同对方所做的事，而是在不认同对方所做的事时，会追问对方为什么这么做，以期来理解对方，是「如果我是你，我会怎么样」。
				- 当共情能力消失后，两个观点不同的人，便无法坐下来好好讲道理，「道不同不相为谋」「不接受反驳」，无法沟通。
			- 孟庆延认为，抽象是极化的核心影响之一，当人们越来越远离具体的人和具体的生活，而把注意力集中在超出自己真实生活体验的抽象之上时，网上就会形成大量抽象的观点，也就是「大道理」。
				- 最后的结果是，当再出现社会事件时，人们每天刷着热搜，看着新闻，表达着自己抽象的同情、怜悯、正义，在不去了解背后原因的情况下，只通过表象来做出简单的是非判断。

		- ✏️ Highlights
			- 在动荡时期，如何找到那个不变的东西？[[钱理群]] 老师给了我们三个启发：一个是大自然，第二个是日常生活，第三是历史。
				- 「实际上在抗战时期，很多人也面临这个问题。动乱时期怎么追求生命永恒。我特别注意到两个现代文学作家。
					- 一个是 [[沈从文]]，他提出一个非常重要的命题：从变动社会里求不变的东西。
					- 另一个是 [[冯至]]，他当时选择在 [[昆明]] 郊区树林里的一个屋子里住，在林间小路，他发现两个永恒：
						- 一个是大自然的永恒，不管社会多动荡，天还是要下雨，云还是要浮动；再一个就是日常生活的永恒，==不管发生什么变化，人该吃饭就吃饭，该睡觉就睡觉，该 [[结婚]] 就结婚，该 [[恋爱]] 就恋爱。==
						  id:: 62b3b1f4-c76b-4ae4-9813-4cab09231bec
					- 我就从这里得到极大启发，找到三个永恒。一个是大自然，第二个就是日常生活，第三个是历史，我研究历史。
	- You Need a [[Horror Movie]] [[Friend]] for a More Frightening, Less [[Lonely]] Life - The [[New York Times]]
		- Author: [[Adrienne Celt]]
		- https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/magazine/horror-movie-friends.html
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- We were all careful with one another, but a layer of brutality ran just below the surface, an implicit understanding that sometimes calling a classmate’s story “interesting” meant you actually thought it was trash.
				- Our politeness kept the program from descending into violence, but it sometimes left me craving a more honest, instinctual response.
			- One thing that helped keep me sane was horror cinema.
				- In these films, mood is not subservient to message: The mood is the message, working to disperse the sedative haze of the everyday. Not everyone in the program was receptive to this point of view.
			- But sharing that understanding with someone makes the world, perhaps paradoxically, less scary.
				- You can’t undo what is terrible about the universe, but you can stand against it together.
	- [[微博]] 现在同时具备资讯和媒体属性，而且变得越来越新闻性，时效性，微博在重媒体和重社交方向上摇摆不定，所以很难说微博到底是社交平台还是信息平台。
		- https://321laixin.zhubai.love/posts/2151211856193597440
		- 为什么有些人已经不再 [[发微博]]，微博从一开始被大家推崇而又慢慢衰败，有个专业的科技词汇可以解释这个现象 - 蒸发冷却效应，
			- 当新成员不断涌入一个开放社团时，组织中最有价值的成员会发现社团成员平均水平的降低让自己继续呆在这里已经没有意义了，于是他们就会选择离开。
			- 这批成员的离开进一步降低了社团的价值，于是恶性循环开始了：越来越多高价值的成员选择离开，直到有一天这个社团彻底的沦陷成了一个平庸的组织。
	- 3 Principles for a Better Life #[[life advice]]
		- Author: [[Mark Manson]]
		- https://markmanson.net/newsletters/mindfck-monthly-101
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- You are perfect just as you are… but you can always be better.
			- Most people aren’t evil, they’re just stupid.
			- A little bit of truth exists in everything; but the whole truth in nothing.
	- Anne Lamott Interview - Finding Time
		- https://www.sunset.com/travel/anne-lamott-how-to-find-time
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- There is nothing you can buy, achieve, own, or rent that can fill up that hunger inside for a sense of fulfillment and wonder.
				- But the good news is that creative expression, whether that means writing, dancing, bird-watching, or cooking, can give a person almost everything that he or she has been searching for: enlivenment, peace, meaning, and the incalculable wealth of time spent quietly in beauty.
				- Then I bring up the bad news: You have to make time to do this.
			- First of all, no one needs to watch the news every night, unless one is married to the anchor. #[[reading news]]
				- Otherwise, you are mostly going to learn more than you need to know about where the local fires are, and how rainy it has been: so rainy! That is half an hour, a few days a week, I tell my students.
				- You could commit to writing one page a night, which, over a year, is most of a book.
			- I’ve heard it said that every day you need half an hour of quiet time for yourself, or your Self, unless you’re incredibly busy and stressed, in which case you need an hour.
				- I promise you, it is there. Fight tooth and nail to find time, to make it.
				- It is our true wealth, this moment, this hour, this day.
	- China’s [[mental-health crisis]] is getting worse | [[The Economist]]
		- https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/21/chinas-mental-health-crisis-is-getting-worse
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Much of China’s population has experienced some form of lockdown this year. #[[Covid Lockdown]]
			- If the virus is not causing enough anguish, there is also the struggling economy. China’s youth-unemployment rate has shot up to 18.4%, the highest on record. Don’t complain too much, though, lest the state take notice. Censorship, surveillance and oppression, on the rise ahead of a Communist Party congress later this year, add to the anxiety
			- But the government itself is a big part of the problem. It is not just that lockdowns and oppression lead to anxiety and depression. The party is also trying to use psychotherapy to mould compliant, socially conservative citizens.

	- 陈亚亚｜ [[贺雪峰]] 的 [问题](((62b1cb2e-b02e-4622-af3d-ef40197a5abb))) 到底是什么
		- https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/683355.html
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- 在我看来，贺的问题主要是搞一言堂。
				- 作为老师，给学生推荐一篇文章，提出自己的看法，这没有问题（哪怕观点有问题），但要求人人表态，去文章下面点赞评论，尤其特别针对低年级的女同学，这就非常糟糕了 。
	- ‘What are our lives for?’: a [[philosopher]] answers kids’ existential questions [[The Guardian]]

		- https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/21/what-are-our-lives-for-a-philosopher-answers-kids-existential-questions
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Every [[child]] is a natural philosopher.
				- They’re puzzled by the world and they try to puzzle it out.
				- And they’re good at it, too.
				- Kids are clever and courageous thinkers.
				- In fact, adults can learn a lot from listening to them – and thinking with them.
			- If God created everything, who created God? Leyha, 7
			- I sometimes feel like I’m the only real person and everyone else is a robot. How can I know if that’s true? Ursula, 8
			- Why are there numbers? Sahil, 5
			- Where was I before I was born and before I was in your belly? Melia, 4
			- Where was I before I was here? Josh, 3
			- Where do you go when you die? Homer, 7
			- What is it like to be dead? Arthur, 8
			- What are our lives for? Caspar, 5
				- But we are here, and we should care about each other, even if the universe doesn’t care about us. There may be no meaning to our lives.
				- But we can find meaning in our lives by filling them with family and friends and fun – and projects that make the world a better place.
				- You get to decide what your life is for, Caspar, so try to make it something cool.
			- Why is it bad to have everything I want? Abraham, 4
			- Why do people end up doing things that they don’t want to do? Sarang, 4
			- Do the needs of the many outweigh those of the few, or do the needs of the few outweigh those of the many? Arthur, 7
			- Is your imagination made of atoms? Josie, 7
