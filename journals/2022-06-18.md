	- Good bacteria to tackle depression
		- https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Good-bacteria-to-tackle-depression.html
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Intestinal flora plays an important role in health – including mental health.
			- Researchers from the [[University of Basel]] and the [[University Psychiatric Clinics Basel]] (UPK) have shown that
				- probiotics can support the effect of antidepressants and help to [[alleviate depression]].
	- How [[Price Shocks]] in Formative Years Scar Consumption for Life - Knowledge at Wharton
		- https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-price-shocks-in-formative-years-scar-consumption-for-life
		- 这是否可以在一定程度上否定那些未经历饥荒的人是无法真正做到 [[忆苦思甜]] 的？
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Teens who experienced [[gas price shocks]] of the 1970s drive less in later years, according to experts at Wharton and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
			- “Individuals respond to price changes during their formative driving years much more so than to price levels,” the paper stated.
				- “[Those] effects are not explained by recessions, income, or costly skill acquisition (learning to drive) and are inconsistent with recency bias, mental plasticity, and standard habit-formation models.
					- Instead, ==they likely reflect formation of preferences for driving or persistent changes in its perceived cost.==”
	- [[Human Attention]] has become a [[Marxist]] commodity
		- https://mebassett.info/human-attention-commodity
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- At the core of [[Marx]]’s Capital is his definition of a commodity: a thing made by human labour that has both a use value (a capacity to satisfy some human want or need) and an exchange value, the latter coming from the human labour used to produce it.
				- What social media has done is turned human attention into such a commodity.
			- Like coal companies hiring miners to operate heavy equipment that strip mines the mountainside,
				- social media companies hire programmers and data scientists to operate “engaging user interfaces” that strip mine your attention.
				- That attention is bought and sold to advertisers.
			- If [[capitalism]] means the exploitation of labour
				- then social media companies mean the endless mining of human attention.
			- You might not have asked to know what your 3rd grade friend thinks of [[Donald Trump]],
				- but without [[Facebook]], you would have never known nor cared.
			- The existence of social media companies has made two changes to society’s ethics here:
				- first, they have convinced people that connections with people “they otherwise wouldn’t be able to connect with” is a product that can only be produced by for-profit corporations.
				- Second, they’ve convinced people that they chose to foster many of these connections, rather than the platform deciding that for them in order to mine their attention more effectively.
	- Overthinking
		- https://kerkour.com/overthinking
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- We all know that “The perfect is the enemy of the good.”, #[[against perfectionism]]
				- still we lose countless hours trying to make the perfect design, the perfect presentation, the perfect specification document, the perfect data model, chose the perfect technology or framework.
			- I’ve tracked down the sources of this problem to 3 causes. 3 poisons from where all the pain originates. These 3 poisons are:
				- Education
					- Education is rarely about doing. It’s mostly about thinking.
						- Thus we learn how to think, and we end up with whole countries filled with people who think, think, think but never start doing anything.
				- Marketing
					- The second poison is marketing pushed by Business to Developers (B2D) companies.
						- These companies, while solving real problems (often something among the lines of scalability or data processing), have great interests to make us believe that
							- we have the problems they are solving and that they are our best hope to solve those problems (we most of the time don't have these problems).
				- Ego
					- We all fear being judged by our work.
						- Thus, to anticipate critics, we start spending time polishing the details.
						- More and more time. One day we realize that all this time flew polishing details while the important points, those bringing real value, are not even started.
			- Solution
				- Stop trying to connect all the dots ahead of time. Embrace [[uncertainty]] and start doing.
	- The Privatized Internet Has Failed Us
		- Author: [[Paris Marx]]
		- https://jacobin.com/2022/06/internet-privatization-profit-centralization-democracy
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Review of Internet for the People: _The Fight for Our Digital Future_ by [[Ben Tarnoff]] (Verso Books, June 2022)
			- In his new book Internet for the People: The Fight for Our Digital Future,
				- Ben Tarnoff argues that those criticisms fail to identify the true problem with the internet.
				- Monopolization, surveillance, and any number of other issues are the product of a much deeper flaw in the system.
				- “The root is simple,” writes Tarnoff: “==The internet is broken because the internet is a business.==”
			- At the core of Tarnoff’s analysis is the question of privatization:
				- how it happened and what consequences it has had for the infrastructures and services that have become virtually inescapable.
			- Take the protocols that allow these various networks to communicate with one another and eventually produced TCP/IP.
				- “Under [[private ownership]], such a language could never have been created,” writes Tarnoff.
					- The basic research work was not only incredibly expensive, but there was no obvious means to make a profit from it.
			- We often call the services offered by these companies “platforms,” but that’s a term Tarnoff rejects.
				- It allows them to “present an aura of openness and neutrality” — when they’re actually shaping what we do for their benefit.
				- Tarnoff instead calls them online malls, private spaces that appear public, in which we’re brought together in service of generating profit for the company that controls it.
			- Deprivatizing the Internet
				- Rather than lay out a concrete plan for a deprivatized internet, Tarnoff explains that experimentation will be key.
				- The future he envisions is one where technology takes on a very different character;
					- where it changes from “something that is done to people, and becomes something they do together.”
				- Instead of waiting to see what Google or Amazon hand us, technology is produced by communities and collectives to serve very different needs and ends.
				- Yet that doesn’t mean Tarnoff leaves us with no map of the path we could take.
	- [[苏联红军]] 女卫生员电影为何感动老胡？ – 北大飞 #胡锡进
		- https://flyingpku.com/%e8%8b%8f%e8%81%94%e7%ba%a2%e5%86%9b%e5%a5%b3%e5%8d%ab%e7%94%9f%e5%91%98%e7%94%b5%e5%bd%b1%e4%b8%ba%e4%bd%95%e6%84%9f%e5%8a%a8%e8%80%81%e8%83%a1%ef%bc%9f/
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- 男权结构下里对女性贞操的占有有着格外重要的意义。 #男权社会
				- 男性强权和民族国家相结合的结果是，[[国家主权]] 的最深层次，不在于占有金钱、资源甚至领土，而在于代表全体男性占有全体女性。
			- 所以 [[德军]] 才要生俘/占有这位女卫生员，并对其实施集体性暴力：德国军人强暴了苏军女卫生员，就是从最深层次上强暴了 [[苏联]] 这个国家。
			- 这里根本不是什么「男性保护女性」，要保卫的是国家/民族尊严的最高含义：
				- 自己所在的民族国家代表自己对本国女性贞操的占有。至于这些女性的生命和尊严本身倒没那么重要。
			- 所以我们可以帮老胡回忆一下年轻的他到底是被什么所感动的：感动他的是那些苏联红军战士的 [[爱国主义]] 精神——还有女卫生员老公的宽宏大量。
	- Interruptions at work are killing your focus, productivity, and motivation
		- Author: [[Jory MacKay]]
		- https://blog.rescuetime.com/interruptions-at-work/
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- How to manage interruptions at work
			- Here’s a few more suggestions of how to handle this from our users:
				- Schedule dedicated time for more complex questions.
				- Decide on which non-urgent form of communication you’ll use.
				- Ask if someone’s free before getting to what you need.
				- Have set “office hours”: If your job involves being available to others for questions, set aside dedicated time rather than being always around.
			- ==记录那些打扰你的人或事==。持续一周之后，我们可以拿来分析这些干扰源。
	- [[性别暴力]] 的中国式治理难题：[[父权制]] 催生的「黑恶势力」，无法被父权本身所清除-   [[端传媒]] #唐山殴打女性
		- https://telegra.ph/%E6%80%A7%E5%88%AB%E6%9A%B4%E5%8A%9B%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%BC%8F%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E9%9A%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%88%B6%E6%9D%83%E5%88%B6%E5%82%AC%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84%E9%BB%91%E6%81%B6%E5%8A%BF%E5%8A%9B%E6%97%A0%E6%B3%95%E8%A2%AB%E7%88%B6%E6%9D%83%E6%9C%AC%E8%BA%AB%E6%89%80%E6%B8%85%E9%99%A4---%E7%AB%AF%E4%BC%A0%E5%AA%92---%E6%9C%80%E6%96%B0-06-14
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- 此作案情节极其恶劣，击破了部分保守者的底线，但是保守主义者并不希望看到，[[性别平等]] 的话语借助人们愤怒的东风而占舆论主导，进而动摇父权制文化的基础，
				- 于是坚持要用黑恶势力的叙事来抹去性别的维度，以继续维系父权制下落后的「有限正义」。
	- 豪赌人生下半场：[[移民]] 路上的中国中产 - [[端传媒]] #中产阶级
		- https://telegra.ph/%E8%B1%AA%E8%B5%8C%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%8A%E5%9C%BA%E7%A7%BB%E6%B0%91%E8%B7%AF%E4%B8%8A%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%B8%AD%E4%BA%A7---%E7%AB%AF%E4%BC%A0%E5%AA%92---%E6%9C%80%E6%96%B0-06-17-5
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- 移民有两个步骤：第一步，放弃已有生活；第二步，追求未知生活。
				- [[年轻人]] 一无所有，对他们而言放弃没有成本，追求也没有代价。
				- 富豪既不需要放弃，也不需要追求，反正他们什么都有。
				- 夹在二者之间的中产最难做决定：放弃国内拥有的一切和构筑在这一切之上的确定性，去追求未知的新世界和全然不同的下半生，无异一场赌博。
			- 对于中产来说，所谓的自由、平等、民主，追根究底也是为了一种更好的个人生活，而他们已经用自己的经济能力和社会地位填补了许多权益的空白。
				- 如果不去过问 [[公共生活]] 的话，他们的日子跟国外的中产相比没有什么区别，而且托低人权优势的福（比如请阿姨来家里打扫卫生 2 小时只需要 100 元），甚至可能比国外的中产还要好一些。
			- 大部分中产一时没有非走不可的理由，他们的心意很大程度上是随着国内重大事件的发生而摇摆的。
				- 比如 [[2017]] 年的红黄蓝幼儿园虐童事件，
				- [[2022]] 年年初的「[[铁链女]]」事件，
				- 还有这次以上海为核心的全国疫情封控中发生的种种侵犯权益的事件。 #上海疫情
				- 这些事件或许==一度让中产感到生活摇摇欲坠、难以忍受，但一旦事情被遗忘，他们的情绪也会过去。==
			- 人们通常认为历史永远向前、不会倒车。
				- 但事实上世界存在崩塌的可能，只是崩塌到来之前，大部分人都没有什么反应。
				- 而一旦崩塌发生，做什么又都太迟了。对于 [[中国人]] 来说，这一切崩塌的可能性化作一个具像化的想象，就是 [[文革]]。
			- 真正的难题在别处。对于老马和赵叔这样的中产来说，最难面对的是亲情的问题。
				- 全家移民通常能带走伴侣和孩子，但几乎不可能同时带走父母。
			- 对于已经离开和将要离开的中产来说，他们的心情绝非当下流行的「润」字可以形容。 #润学
				- 大部分人都在上海封控的几个月里注意到了这个词语的流行，但他们并不热衷于参与这场语义上的狂欢，甚至对这个字有一些抗拒。他们认为「润」忽略了移民中真正沉重和难以承受的部分。
				  id:: 62ba433b-3eb2-4ee5-a6a3-37a61a3be5b1
			- 在上海的这轮疫情防控之前，小爱从来没有真正想过要移民。
				- 她不喜欢这个国家的很多东西，包括意识形态，也包括具体的政策，但她还是想要留在这里，因为她确实在这里获得了她想要的，「而这些东西是没有办法在其他地方获得的」。
			- 这一代中产成长于中国大门敞开的时代，比上一代和下一代都更熟悉也更向往外面的世界。
				- 在做出移民决定之前，他们可能早已跟国外的客户谈了不少生意，或者每年都会带着全家人出国旅行。==这种生活经验是上一代不敢想的，也是下一代正在失去的==。
	- The Six Forces That Fuel [[Friendship]] - [[The Atlantic]] #[[maintain friendship]]
	  id:: 62adc13e-cfe0-4aff-8a52-32d5ccf965e7
		- Author: [[Julie Beck]]
		- https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/06/six-ways-make-maintain-friends/661232/
		- ✏️ Highlights
			- Accumulation
				- The simplest and most obvious force that forms and sustains friendships is time spent together.
				- One [study](zotero://select/library/items/C7ULVFP2) estimates that it takes spending 40 to 60 hours together within the first six weeks of meeting to turn an acquaintance into a casual friend, and about 80 to 100 hours to become more than that.
			- Attention
				- Connection can come from anywhere, at any time, if both parties are open to it.
				- Paying attention goes a long way when forging these unexpected friendships—noticing when you click with someone, being open to chance encounters.
				- Because as much as we may feel like our social networks are set and settled, it’s never too late to meet someone who will be important to you for the rest of your life.
			- Intention
				- Attention only gets you so far without action. When opportunity arises, you have to put yourself out there, and that requires courage, vulnerability, and a willingness to let things be awkward.
				- Most friendships require a bit of courtship to get going.
					- This is the hardest part of friendship. It takes energy and thought, and our mental and physical resources are often spread thin.
			- Ritual
				- One thing that seems to make keeping up with friends easier is ritual. I personally find that the effort of coordinating hangs (or even phone calls) is the biggest barrier to seeing my friends.
				- It’s much easier when something is baked into my schedule, and all I have to do is show up.
				- For instance, while working from home during the pandemic, I’ve gotten lunch every Friday with my friend who lives around the corner (when it’s been safe to do so).
			- Imagination
				- Society has a place for friendships, and it’s on the sidelines. They’re supposed to play a supporting role to work, family, and romance. It takes imagination not to default to this norm, and to design your life so that friendship plays the role you really want it to.
				- there are friends who choose to love each other radically every day. Their love does not stand on the sidelines.
			- Grace
				- I’ve come to believe that friendship doesn’t always have to be about presence; it can also be about love that can weather absence.
				- I cite grace here as the final and most important force in friendships, I mean it in two ways. One is the forgiveness that we offer each other when we fall short. The other is the space that creates for connections—and reconnections—that feel nothing short of miraculous.
