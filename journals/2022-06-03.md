- [[Daily Reading in June]]
	- Back in 2015 I’ve added a list of “People I’d Like to Meet” to my website with the hopes of one day meeting some of my heroes. It’s really special when I get to check one off, or add new ones 💚 #[[meet with friends]]

	- 如何亲手打造一个无所不能的 [[Telegram]]？开个 thread 分享一下，我是怎么把电报用到极致的。
		- 利用电报，我可以看书、观影、听歌、看新闻、和朋友聊天；作为创作者，我可以写字、发视频、上传播客、记录灵感。

		- ✏️ Highlights
			- That’s why friendships formed via shared interests often feel shallow.
				- It’s because a _real_ friend is someone who has things that can’t be listed on a résumé: trust, loyalty, love, belonging, safety, and a sense that they’ll back you up when the times get tough.
			- What makes you unique is not your specific attributes.
				- It’s your specific _ties_ to the network around you.
			- I think one reason many people feel a crisis of meaning is they feel commoditized—and they are!
				- You’re one among millions, not one in a million.
			- We’re human beings, we do not want to be replaceable.
				- We desperately want to be valued for who we are. Becoming disentangled from your web of mutual commitments, shared history, and collective responsibility is to be rendered into a transaction, a slave.
			- We want to be loved, to be secure in the knowledge that no matter how much we’ve torn apart our ratty lives, we can count on someone to grasp us and hoist our fraying ends back into the social fabric.
			- I love it when my friends meet each other and they also become friends.
				- When this happens, it weaves more threads into the social fabric around me, making us all more tightly interconnected.
			- When you have a densely connected network like that, not only are the friendships more rewarding,
				- but everyone else also becomes more important to each other for mutual support
			- One way to create a shared context is through shared struggle.
				- Another way to build context is to consciously choose to do so.
