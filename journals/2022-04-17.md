	- ✏️ Highlights
		- Some [[state media]] commentaries have portrayed the choice between zero-Covid and living with the virus as a struggle between two opposing systems of governance.
		- But that is wrong and dangerous. Shanghai’s lockdown woes show it’s high time China revived the wisdom of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and ‘seek truth from facts’.

			- One of the biggest threats to your future is a world which is dominated not by modern problems but by ancient hatreds. Look around the world and see how much trouble is being caused by people who dislike each other because of their racial or their religious or their ethnic differences that whether it’s in Bosnia or the conflict between the Indians and the [[Pakistan]]is or in the [[Middle East]], or the tribal conflicts in [[Africa]]. You look all over the world you see these kind of problems.
