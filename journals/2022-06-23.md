		- ✏️ Highlights
			- No matter how many times I have recommended [[R Markdown]] users to read the full [[Pandoc]] manual at least once, I still want to recommend it again.
				- You won’t really appreciate how powerful Pandoc’s Markdown is until you read the full manual once.
			- Pure technical issues are often relatively easy to resolve.
				- Things will become complicated whenever humans are involved.
			- Please don’t decide for the user. If I want to open a link in a new tab, my browser makes it easy to do so, and if I want to go back to your document, I use the back button.
			- Good software is never about coding alone.
				- It is about coding plus psychology (thinking one step further to minimize the annoyance).
				- Even trivially small problems are worth thinking.
	- [[体制内]] 固然不怎么开除人，但是代价就是精神上想怎么弄你就怎么弄你，
		- 只要你还想在这个圈子里混，失势的时候就必须得受着，不存在辞职这么一说。
